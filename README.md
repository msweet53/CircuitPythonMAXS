## Circuit Python assignment 1
### Desc.
This code makes it so that the neopixel on the metro express fades between the colors on the RGB spectrum at a variable rate.
### Lessons learned:
I learned that in circuit python to change a variable through addition or subraction you could not just put something like R - 1. You would have to put something like R = R - 1.

## Circuit Python assignment 2
### Desc.
This code makes it so that a LED wired to digital pin 13 blinks at a variable rate.
### Lessons learned.
I learned that you have to determine whether your pin is an output or an input.

## Circuit Python assignment 3
### Desc.
This code makes it so that when you touch one of the wires, the servo moves in one direction, then when you touch the other wire it moves in the opposite direction.
### Lessons Learned:
That when the servo goes over 180 or under 0, it comes back as an error so you have to code to prevent that.

## Circuit Python assignment 4
### Desc.
This makes it so that when you touch one wire the mode changes from up to down or from down to up, then when you touch the other wire the counter will either go up or down depending on which mode it is on, all displayed real time on an lcd screen.
### Lessons Learned:
I learned that with the lcd backpack library for circuit python, the lcd.print() funtion does not work with integers, and you have to turn the integer you want to display into a string with the str() function first.

## Circuit Python Assignment 4
### Desc.
Code so that when you interrupt a phot interrupter, it adds to a counter that refreshes every 4 seconds.
### Lessons Learned:
Doing that without using the sleep() funtion was very difficult.
