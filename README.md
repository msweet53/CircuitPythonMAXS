## Circuit Python assignment 1
### Desc.
This code makes it so that the neopixel on the metro express fades between the colors on the RGB spectrum at a variable rate.
### Lessons learned:
I learned that in circuit python to change a variable through addition or subraction you could not just put something like R - 1. You would have to put something like R = R - 1.

## Circuit Python assignment 3
### Desc.
This code makes it so that when you touch one of the wires, the servo moves in one direction, then when you touch the other wire it moves in the opposite direction.
### Lessons Learned:
That when the servo goes over 180 or under 0, it comes back as an error so you have to code to prevent that.
